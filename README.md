Takes your armor and emblem from the game.
Takes your XP and SR too. You have to amnually refresh the widget, but I go over a way to do that quickly in the instructions. There's no delay between the time you finish a match and gain XP and when the widget can access the data. All data comes direct from 343.

Disclaimer: Your font won't look like the one in the screenshot. I'm jailbroken and added a font that looks like the one from the game.
